This repository contains a **private shell alias collection by Kevin Veen-Birkenbach**.

It is used to support **simpler, faster, and more efficient daily development workflows** by providing short, consistent command aliases across systems.

The collection is intentionally:
- minimal
- personal
- opinionated
- focused on productivity

It serves as a lightweight, evolving toolbox for everyday CLI usage and is not intended as a public framework or shared standard.
